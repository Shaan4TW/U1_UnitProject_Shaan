# #Unit1RadioProject

<h2> Project Description: </h2>
<p> This project is a a virtual radio that contains mostly Electronic Dance Music (EDM). You are able to play music, pause it, 
skip to the next song, and increase/decrease volume. It is made by a really cool dood. </p>

<h2> Inspiration: </h2>
<p> My radio project was inspired by the one and only; Ambroise Dedenis. After seeing his array project which played
different songs, I thought it was really cool. However, I thought that if there was a cool visual along with it, it would be
much better. Therefore, I created this project! </p>
